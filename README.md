# Kabocha Parachain 

Based on the Cumulus Parachain Template. Big thanks to the Substrate team, and special thanks to Dan Shields.

## Crowdloan process 

We are launching as a featureless parachain template, with only balances and vesting. After an auction win, the sudo will populate balances and vested balances with required amounts both from crowdloan participation and EDG snapshot. Balances will have a filter so that people can transfer balances. A runtime upgrade will then occur to include governance related pallets. Once that happens, anyone can make a proposal to kill the sudo account, once that happens a runtime upgrade to unfilter balances will ensue and the chain will be in its first live state. Thereafter, future runtime upgrades to add custom pallets and features will go through Kabocha on-chain governance.

## Kabocha pallet ingredients 

After the feautureless sudo phase of the parachain slot process, we will make a runtime upgrade to add governance functionality, this will enable a proposal to be made to kill the sudo, and this is when the chain will go "Live". Thereafter will be customising governance to be more like Liquid Democracy, we will also be adding functionality to the treasury funding process, where new coins can be minted based on successful proposals, instead of just taking from treasury. We will also be adding NFT functionality. 
## In the works:
This parachain will have novel governance function. We will be working on Liquid Democracy, which will remove the need for council and instead be more focussed on meta-delegation.
